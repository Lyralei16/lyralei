Table of content:

 
The information hierarchie contributes to the understanding and the retention of the presented information AND more than two visualisation methods have been used.
The implemented interactive components are  meaningful AND lead to the presentation of new relevant information for at least 2 visualisation methods
Where relevant an animation has been added to each interactive/dynamic component

The JSON data is requested via an API AND it is used in at least 2 visualization methods (charts, tables or dynamic texts), AND different statistics have been generated (totals, means, sums, different categories, etc).
The data is presented dynamically AND the application communicates  errors sufficiently

All parts are commented according to JSDoc guidelines, all requested theory is mentioned BUT there is a lack of thorough understanding


Excellent (4)
The data visualisation is of excellent quality AND several custom-made original visualisation methods have been used to display the data.
The implemented interactive components are  meaningful AND lead to the presentation of new relevant information for at least 2 visualisation methods AND different types of user interaction are implemented (click events, scroll events, swipe events etc). 
Where relevant an animation has been added to each interactive/dynamic component AND SVG or CSS animations have been used

The JSON data is requested via an API AND it is used in more than 2 visualization methods (charts, tables or dynamic texts), AND different statistics have been generated (totals, means, sums, different categories, etc).
The data is presented dynamically AND the application communicates  errors sufficiently AND the application can show information for different categories seperately (fireworks violations and violent crimes for example). 

All parts are commented according to JSDoc guidelines, all requested theory is mentioned AND student demonstrated a thorough understanding of mentioned theory
